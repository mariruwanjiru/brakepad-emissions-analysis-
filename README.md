# Brake Pad Emissions Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes **brake pad emissions** across three materials: **Ceramic, Semi-Metallic, and NAO**. It investigates emission levels, manufacturing processes, and the relationship between brake pad dimensions and emissions.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following key attributes:
- **Brake Pad Material** (Ceramic, Semi-Metallic, NAO)
- **Dimensions** (Width, Height, Thickness in mm)
- **Emissions Levels** (Low, Moderate, High)
- **Manufacturing Processes** (Acquisition, Processing, Packaging, Distribution)

## Analysis & Visualizations
This project performs:
- **Emissions Level Distribution Analysis** (Bar charts showing emissions % per material)
- **Manufacturing Process Comparison** (How each material's production process differs)
- **Scatter Plots & Regression Analysis** (How dimensions relate to emissions)

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Data analysis and visualization)
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation)
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** (Visualizations)
- **Statsmodels** (Regression Analysis)
- **Jupyter Notebook & VS Code** (Development)

## ⚙How to Run the Code
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd brakepad-emissions-analysis
```
### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have **Python 3+** installed, then run:
```sh
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib statsmodels
```
### 3️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
Open `Brakepad_Analysis.ipynb` and execute the cells.

## Results & Key Findings
- **Ceramic brake pads** have the lowest emissions.
- **NAO brake pads** produce the highest emissions.
- **Thickness is a significant predictor of emissions**, while width & height have weaker correlations.
